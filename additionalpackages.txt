Jazzy
Start with https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html and install ros-jazzy-desktop

Then add the following packages
ros-jazzy-navigation2 
ros-jazzy-nav2-bringup

For Turtlebot, according to
https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot4/issues/412
Turtlebot is already supported and integrated with Rviz/Gazebo. However, an out of the box installation crashes gazebo. Both tb3 and tb4 work with headless:=True (i.e., rviz visualization only)

Then follow https://turtlebot.github.io/turtlebot4-user-manual/software/turtlebot4_simulator.html
and run

sudo apt-get install curl
sudo curl https://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.gpg --output /usr/share/keyrings/pkgs-osrf-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/pkgs-osrf-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gz-harmonic

Note: installed this way, gz sim fails. The following fixes the problem
echo 'export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Note that https://turtlebot.github.io/turtlebot4-user-manual/software/turtlebot4_simulator.html#dev-tools
suggests to run
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-turtlebot4-simulator ros-jazzy-irobot-create-nodes
but as of 11/13/2024 it does not work (packages not found)


sudo apt install ros-jazzy-turtlebot3-*
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-turtlebot4-*

https://docs.clearpathrobotics.com/docs/ros/
